In data science, we work with <b>tables</b>, which are much more strictly structured. In a table, data are arranged into rows and columns such that each column is a property of whatever a row represents. You will also often hear people refer to rows of a table as \"entries\".\n",

    "### Pandas `DataFrame`s\n",
    "The most commonly used data management package in Python is called `pandas`. What we call tables, `pandas` calls <b>DataFrames</b>. If you're worked in the R programming language before, you'll have a head start with `pandas`! You will often see `DataFrame`s abbreviated as `df`, in code examples. Run the cell below to see a (very simple) example of a `DataFrame`. (Don't worry about what the cell is doing just yet.)"

For example, the class title corresponding to the course \"Data 8\" is \"Foundations of Data Science\". The number on the left of the `DataFrame` corresponds to the \"index\" of the row. For example, entry 4 (which is actually the 5th row from the top, because Python uses 0-based indexing!) corresponds to the row with L&S 88-2.

For example, we can make `numpy` arrays that correspond to different attributes. Note that the order of attributes in each array matters, and each array has to be the same size. Run the cell below to see an example of what this means. When we make the `DataFrame` itself, the input to the function, `pd.DataFrame()` is a Python dictionary with the column title and the array with the data in it."
