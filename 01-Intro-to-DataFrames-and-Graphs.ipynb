What we call tables or spreadsheets, `pandas` calls <b>DataFrames</b>. If you've worked in the R programming language before, you'll have a head start with `pandas`! You will often see `DataFrame`s abbreviated as `df` in code examples. Run the cell below to see a (very simple) example of a `DataFrame`. (Don't worry about what the cell is doing just yet.)"

For example, entry 4 (which is actually the 5th row from the top, because Python uses 0-based indexing!) corresponds to the row with L&S 88-2.

Run the cell below to see an example of what this means.
