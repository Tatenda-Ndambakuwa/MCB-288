    "## Introduction to Pandas and Dataframes\n",
    "Many of you may be familiar with the spreadsheet software Excel. In Excel, you can put anything you want into any cell you want. In data science, we work with <b>tables</b>, which are much more strictly structured. In a table, data are arranged into rows and columns such that each column is a property of whatever a row represents. You will also often hear people refer to rows of a table as \"entries\". \n",
    "### Pandas DataFrames\n",
    "The most commonly used data management package in Python is called Pandas. What we call tables, Pandas calls <b>DataFrames</b>. You will often see DataFrames abbreviated as `df`, in code examples. Run the cell below to see a (very simple) example of a DataFrame. (Don't worry about what the cell is doing just yet.)"

For example, the class title corresponding to the course \"Data 8\" is \"Foundations of Data Science\". The number on the left of the DataFrame corresponds to the \"index\" of the row. For example, entry 4 (which is actually the 5th row from the top, because Python uses 0-based indexing!) corresponds to the row with L&S 88-2. Now that you know what a DataFrame is, let's move on to making our own!\n",
    "### Making Dataframes\n",
    "There are two basic ways of creating DataFrames. The first is to make one by typing the data into Python manually. For example, we can make Numpy arrays that correspond to different attributes. Note that the order of attributes in each array matters, and each array has to be the same size. Run the cell below to see an example of what this means. When we make the DataFrame itself, the input to the function, `pd.DataFrame()` is a Python dictionary with the column title and the array with the data in it."
